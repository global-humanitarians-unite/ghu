                possible. Our mission is to assist in the development and expansion of

                <p>We support humanitarian organizations around the world. By providing
                online services, we aid fellow humanitarians in gathering resources and
                coordinate large-scale efforts that involve our member organizations. Our
                membership fees and donations from global partners are used in funding
                these efforts. We continuously form alliances that allow us to provide an
                abundance of resources to humanitarians who are already working to make a
                difference.</p>
